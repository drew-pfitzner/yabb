# YNABB to-do list

How this works: ask Claude to "add X to the todo list", or edit this file. When a job starts, it moves to **Now** with who's on it. When the change ships, Claude moves it to **Done** with the date.

## Now

- [x] **Dani: get set up** with `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` (invite sent 5 Oct; YNABB login made) (Dani)
- [ ] **Test-open one iCloud backup on the Mac** with the key from the password manager (`node server/backup.js decrypt`), to prove a restore works away from the A6.

## Next

1. [ ] **Retire the four claude.ai copies** (YABB, Test, Fresh, Redo) once Dani is happy the A6 budget matches. Download a final backup of each first. Deleting them is permanent, so it's Drew or Dani's call.

## Ideas

- After 12 Oct 2026: delete the old Docker volumes `yabb_yabb-data` and `yabb_tailscale-state` on the A6 (kept as a safety net after the rename). Never start them again: the Tailscale one is the same device as `ynabb`.

- Two-factor login codes
- Rules screen as its own page, with more powers
- Unit tests for `engine.js`
- Serve Google Fonts locally (no outside calls)

## Done

- 2026-10-10: **Settings, amounts and phone pickers (Drew).** Settings are grouped cards with one-line rows and much less text, in two columns on wide screens. Money boxes take the dot as you type it (no more cents filling in), with a dot key on the number pad. The transaction sheet drops the ⋯ menu and shows 'Add a bank description' under the payee. Phone pickers show plain background under the list while the keyboard is up.
- 2026-10-10: **No more lost fixes after shipping (Drew).** If fixes were saved on a branch after it went live, session start, /ship and /sync now keep them and move them onto a new branch, instead of deleting the branch.
- 2026-10-10: **Phone tidy-up and transfers to tracking accounts (Drew).** Phone Transactions: long account names end in "…", Import & reconcile sits in a footer row on the account card, the top row is just Search, Filters and +, and Select (then All / Done) sits beside the count. Select mode on a phone for picking several, with a selection bar that fits. Possible doubles show while reconciling, and a typed transfer can merge with the bank's copy. Money moved into a tracking account (super, shares) is spent from a category. Updating a tracking account's value adds one adjustment. Money boxes show commas (1,234.50).
- 2026-10-10: **Lighter transaction sheet (Drew).** Big amount at the top with Out/In beside it, date and account as small chips, payee with the bank description under it, and Note, Receipt and Cleared as chips. Rare options sit behind ⋯, delete is a bin icon.
- 2026-10-10: **Search past transactions while reconciling (Dani).** A quiet 'Search past transactions' link under the reconcile card opens a search of everything already checked (payee, bank description, note), to see what a shop was called and categorised as before.
- 2026-10-10: **PDF receipts open inside YNABB (Dani).** They show in the receipt viewer with a × to close, instead of opening a page with no way back in the home-screen app.
- 2026-10-10: **Import & reconcile in one go (Dani).** One button opens your bank, takes the downloaded file, imports it and reconciles straight away using the file's balance (which you can change). Likely pairs (different amount or date, paid in one go, charged in parts, pending gone through, edited since the last reconcile) are matched at import for you to check, in a grouped checklist with Manual → Bank lines and a ? for what each group means. Reconcile finishes by itself once everything is ticked. Uncategorised transactions show orange with a Still to do strip, Might Be Swapped pairs swap in two steps, and the edit screen fits a phone. New practice test: `test-data/ANSWER-KEY-3.md`.
- 2026-10-09: **Phone polish (Drew).** Accounts: the totals fit on a phone, with net worth as a slim line beside Add account. Money boxes fill from the right like a card terminal (type 1 0 0 for 1.00) and do sums (25.00×3); on phones and tablets they use YNABB's own number pad. Payee boxes search your payees (full screen on a phone), drop-downs on a phone slide up from the bottom, and date boxes no longer push sheets sideways on iPhone.
- 2026-10-06: **Envelope guide (Dani).** The guide now teaches budgeting with envelopes and small animations: great-grandma's payday envelopes, then give every dollar a job, plan for big rare bills, roll with the punches, know where it goes, choose what matters, and work towards freedom. YNABB only comes in at the end, with a map from each envelope idea to its YNABB name. Two quick tap-an-answer checks, far fewer words, and the setup and weekly steps use the same envelope wording.
- 2026-10-05: **Phone budget polish (Dani).** Each group is its own rounded card, and its heading sticks until the next group pushes it up. The Ready to Assign line is slimmer, with an 8px gap under it. Group headings have no bar (computer too). Sub-categories step in under their group. Phone header styles no longer leak onto group headings, which shared the 'top' class.
- 2026-10-05: **Phone app, round two (Dani).** 'Save' is now **Freedom** (Needs, Wants and Freedom). Phone: a header that stays put with the pie logo, sticky group and date headings, and the Ready to Assign box turning into a line in its colour. Transactions: grouped by day, one line each with a Payee/Note switch, tap to see more. A category's settings show 'Spent this month', which opens Transactions filtered to it.
- 2026-10-05: **Phone app and tidier budget (Dani).** Add YNABB to the home screen as an app (sharp icon, full screen) with pull-down-to-refresh. Phone Budget page: one slim line per category; tap one to see Assigned, Spent and Available, with a pencil for its settings. Category settings: a target card, this month's transactions, and More options on its own page (Name, Counts as Need/Want/Save, Group, Note). On the computer, the Target column and % bar start off each time.
- 2026-10-05: **Real budget moved to the A6** (Family budget: 701 transactions, no receipts to carry across). Backed up straight away, restore-checked, and confirmed in iCloud.
- 2026-10-05: **Git autopilot.** `/ship`, `/sync` and `/undo` in Claude Code; sessions start by fetching from GitHub; GitHub checks every pull request (scripts load, tests, Docker build, no private data); `main` only takes pull requests that pass, and merges them automatically.
- 2026-10-05: **Renamed YNABB** ("Yikes Not Another Bloody Budget"): app, pages, docs, repo, containers, folders and the web address (https://ynabb.tail8c1464.ts.net). Kept for compatibility: the backup format id `zero-line`, old backup files (still read and rotated), and `tag:yabb` in Tailscale.
- 2026-10-05: Backup key saved in the password manager.
- 2026-10-05: **Auto-deploy.** The A6 checks GitHub `main` every 2 minutes, installs anything new, checks it's healthy, and rolls back if not. The admin page shows the live version and the last update. (A "Deploy now" button wasn't worth it at 2 minutes.)
- 2026-10-05: **Backups running.** Every night at 2am (catching up if the A6 was off): encrypted copy to `C:\YNABB-backups` and iCloud (`JARVIS/Family/YNABB`), kept 14 daily, 8 weekly, 12 monthly; receipts kept forever; weekly restore check; status and "Back up now" on the admin page. First backup taken, restore-checked and confirmed in iCloud on the Mac.
- 2026-10-05: **Live on the A6 at https://ynabb.tail8c1464.ts.net.** Docker plus a Tailscale Funnel container tagged `tag:yabb`, which the tailnet policy blocks from every other device. Tested from the public internet: HTTPS, sign-in, live sync, and the sign-in log shows real addresses. Runbook: `deploy/README.md`.
- 2026-10-05: **Backend built and tested on the Mac.** Node + SQLite server with logins (lockouts, rate limits, sign-in log), separate budgets, an account and admin page, live sync, receipts, and a change log that keeps every edit. `store.js` talks to it. The money box no longer uses eval, so the page can run under a strict security policy. Empty budgets can now restore a backup.
- 2026-10-05: Repo set up and on GitHub; private data kept out; test data scrubbed; self-hosting page fixes (charset, `[hidden]`)
