# YNABB server

One file (`server.js`), no npm packages: Node 22.13 or newer, using its built-in SQLite. It serves the app from `../app`, plus:

- **Logins** with scrypt-hashed passwords and session cookies (HttpOnly, SameSite; Secure in production).
  - Five wrong passwords lock a login for 15 minutes. Ten from one address make that address wait 15 minutes.
  - Sessions end after 14 days unused or 90 days total.
- **Separate budgets.** Each person belongs to one budget. Admins can open any budget from `/account`.
- **The document API** `store.js` uses: `GET /api/events` (the whole budget, then live changes), `PATCH`/`PUT /api/doc/:coll/:id`, and receipts at `POST /api/blob` and `GET /_blob/:id`.
- **A change log.** Every write goes into the `changes` table and is never deleted. A replace (restore) also keeps the document it replaced.
- **`/account`** for everyone (password, sign out), with the admin tools (budgets, people, sign-in log) for admins.

## Run it on your computer

```sh
npm run add-admin -- drew Drew   # first time only: prints a password
npm run dev                      # http://127.0.0.1:8080
npm test                         # the server tests
```

Data goes in `data/` (gitignored): `ynabb.sqlite` plus `blobs/` for receipts. Delete the folder to start again.

## Settings (environment variables)

| Variable | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT`, `HOST` | `8080`, `127.0.0.1` | Where it listens. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | The database and receipts. **This is the folder to back up.** |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | on | Set `0` only for plain-http testing on your own computer. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | off | Set `1` behind Tailscale, so sign-in logs and limits see the visitor's real address. |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_NAME` | | On first start with no logins, creates the super admin and a "Family" budget. |
| `APP_VERSION` | `dev` | Shown on the account page, so you can see which version is live. |

Emergency only (needs a shell on the server): `node server/server.js reset-password <username>`.
